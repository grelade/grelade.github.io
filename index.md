### Hi, I'm Jacek Grela. This is a tentative list of projects I did in my spare time.

# Solutions to your problems

- [saddle](https://github.com/grelade/saddle) *[python]*

Having some function and wondering about its minima? That's so 2019, what about stationary points?
Try out this algorithm now and find all possible stationary points with any stability index!

# Serious projects

- [binary classifier](https://github.com/grelade/PulsarClassify) *[python+jupyter]*

This is a serious classifier project to earn me some credibility.

- Reinforcement Learning study *[python]*

Reasonably configurable examples of Reinforcement Learning [gridworlds](https://github.com/grelade/RL_gridworlds) and [mountain car](https://github.com/grelade/RL_mountaincar).

# Silly stuff

Still find star wars kid funny? You're behind, catch up fast with this meme popularity analyzer. A simple meme scrape and analyze tool from reddit; identifies popular formats through clustering algorithms. Platform runs on bottlepy; scripts for either online or offline use.
